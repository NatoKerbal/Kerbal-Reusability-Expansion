# Special thanks to:

- nli2work for making the legs work initially for 1.1. The setup has since been redone but it would have been much harder without that help.
- DerpyFirework for contributing the "DeployableAeroSurfaces" plug-in for the grid fins. It is in the public domain and the source code can be found here.
- EmbersArc to make this mod become a reality!
